# Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java and Android Studio. This readme file provides an overview of the game and guides you on how to set it up and play it.     

# Game Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking their respective symbols (usually X and O) on the grid, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the other player does. This implementation of the game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive and user-friendly experience.
